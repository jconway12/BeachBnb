To dos:
- Reservations: errors are insufficient, need to see unavailable dates, stay put with scroll
    - reservation showpage for hosts?? on click on profile?
- styling (sign in errors toggle, general UI/UX)
- Google maps markers: must be a way to view listing related to marker 
- Search: date and bounds search does not function, date buttons on search bar when working (styling is hard) (OVERALL REWORK THE QUERYING)
- Efficiency: N+1 queries, normalize state using jbuilder (reviews, listings) (instead of complicated fetching)
- Profile: host profile has link to reservations show of given listing, host/ renter profiles should be available w/ reviews to relevant users (overall bare)
- Reviews: currently only for listings, not using review form (where have you been), add rating capability (avg. rating for listings, filter..)
- New Listing: lat/ lng pre-fill, image preview, make prettier
