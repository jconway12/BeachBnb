To dos:
- Reservations: form w/ react dates does not work, errors are insufficient, reservation show page linked from upcoming trips, cannot view current reservations on listing/ host profile
- get better photos and theme data (THEME: BeachBnb) - fix LAT/LNG
- README
- Google maps markers: must be a way to view listing related to marker 
- Search: date and bounds search does not function, only city can be null, date buttons on search bar when working (styling is hard) (OVERALL REWORK THE QUERYING)
- Efficiency: N+1 queries, normalize state using jbuilder (reviews, listings) (instead of complicated fetching)
- Reviews: currently only for listings, not using review form (where have you been), add rating capability (avg. rating for listings, filter..)
- Profile: host/ renter profiles should be available w/ reviews to relevant users

Styling: 
- toggle class to error inputs
- new listing form (lat/lng prefill, image preview?)
- reservation form stays put w/ scroll
- general UI/UX needs improvement
